# R_Midterm_Project

Ahmed Mokhtar

Below is the basic flow of my project:

1. Start by performing very simple structural fixes to the datasets.
  This is done so that the EDA can be useful, and yield comprehensive results.
  
2. Perform an EDA on all 3 datasets
 This EDA will be done in order to provide myself and the reader a brief introduction
 to the data at hand. Results from this may influence the cleaning that will be performed 
 in the next step.
